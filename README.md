### Hello! My name is Matt, and welcome to my Github profile!
###### I love to program in lower-level languages such as C and sometimes in C++!
###### I'm currently finishing the very last part of my 4-year Computer Science degree
###### The perfect program is one that only requires the minimum amount of resources
